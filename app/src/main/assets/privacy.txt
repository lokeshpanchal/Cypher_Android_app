improve services for young people and content filtering. This
information is not identifiable therefore you will remain anonymous.
You can share secrets of 200 characters or less and by sharing you
give Cypher full permission to share your secret as deemed
appropriate by Cypher. We retain the full right of ownership
of all posts and content shared on Cypher.</FONT></P>
